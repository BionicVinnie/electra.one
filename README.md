# Electra One Repository

![image](https://github.com/martinpavlas/electra.one/raw/master/docs/electra-top-silver.jpg)

Welcome to the public repository of the Electra One MIDI Controller project. The repository is meant for people who want to help with development of synthesizer definitions (Electra Instrument Files) and Electra presets.

We would like encourage people to share their work - their presets and instrument files. That is the way to make Electra One a very useful device and it will make synthesizer programming very accesible to people without deeper knowledge of MIDI.

Also, we would like to ask you to share your ideas and frustrations with us. We will do our best to reflect them in future releases of both Electra One firmware and Electra Editor.

## Electra Editor
Electra does not need to be connected to a computer to work. The connection to computer, however, ias required when you want to upload or edit presets.

The Electra Editor is a web application. Chrome browser is required, because it fully supports WebMIDI standard.

The User Guide is still under developmen t, feel free to attach your comments and questions to it. We are updating it on regular basis as new features are added.

## Firmware updates
Electra's firmware is under development. We publish releases of new firmware on regular basis. We made the update procedure very simple to encourage users to update their firmware frequently. The new firmware releases consists of both: new features and bug fixes.
